# Question:
# Compare Python and JavaScript

# Ans:
# 
# 1. Python is like formal language, its runtimes depends on installation and version of python.
#    Javascript only has standard, its runtimes depends on which browser you use or engine like Nodejs
# 
# 2. Javascript's numeric type only has float. Python has int and float.
# 
# 3. Python has built-in hash tables like dictionary and set. JavaScript does not.
# 
# 4. Python use class-based inheritance model. JavaScript use prototype-based inheritance model
# 
# 5. JavaScript does not need exact number of parameters to invoke function. 
#    If there is less number of parameters than it declared, missing parameters will be "undefined".
#    If there is more, you can arguments object which contains an array of the parameters.
# 
# 6. JavaScript is weakly typed which has implicit conversion between types, Python is not.
